Would you like another cup of tea, Mr. Wizard?
Why yes my dear, I would love another cup!
Confused, the boy shouted:
‘What’s going on here?!’
A tea party?
This was all just a misunderstanding! The princess wasn’t taken, she was just having a tea party with her friend, Mr Wizard!
As it turned out, the wizard’s letter to her parents was lost in the mail,
and the princess had forgotten to tell her parents where she was going.
Laughing, the boy said--huh? Oh...He's asleep.
