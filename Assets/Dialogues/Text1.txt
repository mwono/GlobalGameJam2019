Storytime! Storytime!
Alright, alright, calm down BOI. What do you want to listen to tonight?
The one about the hero and his quest for the truth?
The fearless space captain and his motley crew of pirates?
Or maybe--
The hero! The one with the skeletons and flying islands!
You got it.
*AHEM*
In the land of Vesta there was kind and fair princess loved by all…
Her parents, the king and queen, were just rulers. Perfect in almost every way.
All was well in the land of Vesta when tragedy struck.
One day, the princess was kidnapped from the castle by an evil wizard.
The queen, struck by grief, collapsed.
The king, desperate to save his daughter made an announcement to his kingdom:
‘Hear me, hear me, people of the realm! Your princess has been taken from you!
To all who would be heroes to your king, queen, and princess, go east! Defeat the wizard and save my daughter!’
A young farm boy, upon hearing his king’s announcement, took up his father’s sword and set out to save the princess.
