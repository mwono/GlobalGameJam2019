Storytime! Storytime!
Alright, alright, calm down BOI! What do you want to listen to tonight?
The one about the hero and his quest?
The fearless space captain and his motley crew of pirates?
Or maybe--
The hero! The one with the skeletons and flying islands!
You got it.
*AHEM*
In the land of Vesta there was a boy who lived alone in a cabin in the woods.
He was not lonely though, for he had plenty of friends.
Every morning the squirrels, deer, and birds of the forest would visit the boy and greet him a good morning.
They would play and laugh the day away until it came time for the boy to sleep again.
One day though, no one came. 
Instead, he found a sword and a letter telling him to leave the forest, find his true home, and return the sword to his father.
The boy was not sure what this meant, but he followed the letter’s instructions and left.
